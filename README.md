## 🔭 Some of my Experiences

- I worked at a company called Questica in summer of 2022, I worked on a few small projects there including an Integrations Dashboard for the IT department and a Microsoft Teams chatbot for the sales department (so they wouldn't bother the devs). Sadly most of the code from my time their is still in use and I am not permitted to upload it publicly
- I am an ECE Ambassador at the University of Toronto. This means I participated in outreach events where I spoke in front of 200+ people about the Electrical and Computer Engineering Divion at the University. I was also responsible for giving tours and managing prospective students questions.
